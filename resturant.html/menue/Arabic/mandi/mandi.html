    <p> At Fusion Bazaar Eatery, our Mandi is a culinary journey through the aromatic flavors of the Arabian Peninsula. This traditional dish, originating from Saudi Arabia and Yemen, is a true delight for the senses.
    
        We start by selecting the finest cuts of meat, whether it's succulent chicken, tender lamb, or flavorful goat. The meat is then marinated in a blend of aromatic spices, including cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and bay leaves, along with garlic, ginger, and other secret ingredients that infuse it with rich flavor.</p>
