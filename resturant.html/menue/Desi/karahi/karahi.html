    <p>At Fusion Bazaar Eatery, our Karahi is a culinary masterpiece that pays homage to the vibrant flavors of Pakistani cuisine. Named after the traditional cooking vessel it's prepared in, our Karahi is a symphony of aromatic spices, tender meat, and fresh herbs.

        We start by carefully selecting the finest cuts of meat, whether it's succulent chicken, juicy lamb, or tender beef. These meats are then cooked in a traditional Karahi, a wide, shallow cooking pot, over an open flame.
        
        Our secret blend of spices, including cumin, coriander, turmeric, and garam masala, infuses the meat with layers of rich, complex flavors. Freshly chopped tomatoes, onions, and green chilies add a burst of color and freshness to the dish, while aromatic herbs like cilantro and mint lend a fragrant finish.</p>
